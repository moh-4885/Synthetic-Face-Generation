# Synthetic-Face-Generation
This project involves generating face images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The codebase is implemented in Python with TensorFlow and Keras, and it aims to create a model capable of generating realistic face images.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to design and train a GAN model to produce new face images. This project uses a dataset of facial images and leverages deep learning techniques to achieve realistic face generation.

## Getting Started

## Project Structure
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: The notebook first loads and preprocesses images.
- GAN Model Definition: Defines the generator and discriminator network architectures.
- Training the GAN: Trains the GAN model over multiple epochs.
- Image Generation: Uses the trained GAN model to generate new face images
