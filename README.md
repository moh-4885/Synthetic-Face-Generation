# Synthetic-Face-Generation
## overview :
This repository presents a deep learning project focused on generating realistic human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The implementation leverages the power of TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. The project aims to:

- Generate high-quality, diverse, and realistic human faces.
- Explore the potential of GANs for creative applications and computer vision tasks.
- Provide a practical implementation and a solid foundation for further research.
